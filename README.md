I really began the project today. I really think this could be useful to people and especially myself even if just a little. I experiemented using a free maps api called mapped box that I think will be able to do anything I need. I struggled to implement the map slightly but I think it mainly has to do with my inexperience with apis and how to use certain keys to get authorized. I am also trying to implement a working search box that has suggestions populate below. I'm struggling a little to learn react with useEffect and useRef but I think im getting better. I used useRef to manipulate the DOM instead of the typical ways with js and document.blahblah. useEffect allows me to add event listeners to elements on the DOM right as their loaded but im still confused on the cleaning up bit with the return statement that removes the event listener. I'm keep working and making progress!

Im determined to create a map component in react. at first I was struggling with importing the js from the html from the tutorials on using their api but i just needed to npm i mapbox-gl then import into the component. I also found out that when using useRef I always need to use the object/element.current or else im not referencing the correct object.

Im a little stuck on creating the MapBox component. I having trouble adding the routes but Im not getting errors so its almost worse.
